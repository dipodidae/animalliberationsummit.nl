For breakfast, we eat soy yoghurt and scroll through social media to share images of animal suffering. By day we hand out flyers against fur, give water to pigs in transport trucks destined for slaughter, take in animals from the industry, and protest in front of dolphinariums. When evening approaches, we diligently poster our cities calling for the abolition of factory farming or stand in front of restaurants serving foie-gras. When night falls...well, we lose sleep, confronted with the reality of what non-human animals have to face every day.

We are the animal liberation movement. We believe that animals should not be locked up, raped, and killed for humanityâ€™s selfish pleasures. We want animals to be free to do what they want, free from cages and eventual murder. We do not intend to stop fighting for this until basic rights of these oppressed individuals have been granted. We are the animal liberation movement.

Sometimes it feels lonely and pointless. As if there will never be a means to an end to these violent industries. Collectively, however, we can bring about meaningful change and connect on our struggle to see it through. During the Animal Liberation Summit we meet fellow activists. We will laugh, talk, discuss, and eat together. Because we need each other.
