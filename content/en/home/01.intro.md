# Animal Liberation Summit

When the government threatened to halve the amount of ‘livestock’ in 2019, farmers responded by blockading highways, making burning barricades, storming the house of a minister, and otherwise coming together with thousands of people. Our opponents are working together to accomplish their goals.

The animal rights and liberation movement, on the other hand, seems to be comprised of a lot of separate groups and individuals working to accomplish similar goals. In organising this event we hope to bring these groups and individuals together to create a wider and more connected movement in the Netherlands. We believe that our movement can become stronger and more effective through collaboration, mutual support, and a shared commitment to each other's actions and struggles.
