# What's the Summit?

The Animal Liberation Summit is an event for animal activists. You will meet likeminded people and get to know each other outside of actions. There will be opportunities to learn new skills and get to know groups, and to discuss around topics we find important. Various existing groups will present their campaigns and actions. Attendees will have opportunities to acquire new skills, connect with groups, and engage in discussions on topics we deem important.
