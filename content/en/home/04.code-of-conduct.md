# Safer Space

Our aim is to create an inclusive space where people of color, queer individuals, women, and other marginalized groups feel welcomed. Our goal is not only for the movement to be as wide as possible, but also to resist all types of oppression. We oppose the oppression of both human and non-human animals. During the event, we want to minimize our oppressive behavior as much as possible.
